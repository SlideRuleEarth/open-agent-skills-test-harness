# Contained HOME — handoff

Branch: `harness/contained-home-81`, off `main` at `5b9579e` (the #84 merge).
Umbrella issue: #81. Predecessors: #82 (Phase 0 hermeticity), #84 (provenance + Phase 1 MCP).

Read this instead of the #84 diff. Everything below is what you need to start; the reasoning
behind it is in `DESIGN_MCP_Support.md` §5.3 and `TODO_Version_Provenance.md`.

## 0. STATUS — claude is DONE (2026-07-23)

The open decision is settled and the claude adapter is implemented, mutation-tested, and
live-verified. What changed:

- **Decision: MATERIALIZE.** Contained mode is `isolation.build_isolated_home(
  contained_subpaths=...)` — `None` keeps the historical symlink overlay; a sequence
  (including empty) switches the wholesale symlink pass OFF and copies only what is named, so
  `home_write_escapes()` returns `[]` and `_refuse_uncontained_home` lifts **untouched**.
- **claude's surface is `[]` — nothing copied.** On macOS claude authenticates from the login
  **keychain**, not from HOME, so a contained HOME needs `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` exported
  (the operator exports it like any `${VAR}`; the harness does **not** read the keychain).
  Verified live on 2.1.113: an empty contained HOME runs, calls its MCP tool, and still emits
  `claude_code_version` in its init event.
- **The materialize cost/downside for claude is therefore zero** — no credential duplication,
  no per-adapter live-run loop. That will NOT hold for the next adapters (see §1).
- **Both in-overlay pass-through sites also copy under containment** (vendor skills in
  `_build_skills_dir`, plugin packages in `_mask_plugin_registry_dir`) — the easy-to-miss part.
- **A contained subpath colliding with a mask is refused at build time** (`_insert_copy_leaf`):
  copying the real MCP config over the neutral `{}` would be contained but a hermeticity
  regression that looks like it worked.
- Verification: selftest **469 arms** (was 461: +9, −1 decorative), `mutate_mcp.py`
  **79/79** caught by the intended arm, live credential run contained with the token in no
  artifact and no real-home file. `mutate_mcp.py` gained a per-selftest `timeout` so a looping
  mutation can never again wedge the suite.

## 0b. STATUS — all four adapters are now mapped (2026-07-27)

The prediction in the paragraph this replaces was **wrong in the interesting direction**, and
the way it was wrong is the finding. It said the next adapters' auth "may well live under
HOME, so their `contained_home_subpaths` will be non-empty and the credential-duplication
story becomes real for them". Measured, on macOS:

| adapter | credential store | surface | duplication |
|---|---|---|---|
| claude 2.1.113 | login keychain | `[]` + `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | none |
| copilot 1.0.72 | login keychain | `[]` + `GH_TOKEN` (or `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`) | none |
| antigravity 1.1.7 | login keychain | **unmapped (`None`) — no route exists** | n/a |
| codex 0.140.0 | **file** (`~/.codex/auth.json`) | `[".codex/auth.json"]` | real |

**Three of four keep auth in the macOS login keychain, which a contained home structurally
cannot reach** — reaching it needs `~/Library/Keychains`, and that is an outward symlink,
which containment forbids by its own escape rule. Copying is not the fallback: that file is
every password on the machine. claude's note had already worked this out for claude; what is
new is that it generalizes, and that it makes the env-var token the *normal* answer rather
than a claude peculiarity. Materialize's headline cost — duplicating long-lived credentials —
turns out to apply to exactly **one** adapter.

**The method mattered more than any single answer.** Additive probing (guess a surface, see if
it works) confirmed nothing and produced two wrong guesses for copilot — `.copilot/config.json`
*looks* like the credential store, and the CLI's own error message points at `gh auth login`.
What worked is **subtractive**: start from the overlay, which is known to work, and mask
top-level HOME entries until auth breaks. `harness/tools/probe_contained_home.py --bisect`
does that in ~7 runs and lands on `~/Library`, then `~/Library/Keychains` confirms it. The
tool drives the harness's own launch path (`build_isolated_home` → `adapter.env` →
`adapter.build_argv` → `exec.run_captured`), so what it measures is what a cell would get.

**All of this was measured on macOS, and `contained_home_subpaths` is not platform-conditional
— but the gap that leaves is narrower than it first looks.** The harness runs on macOS *and*
Linux; only Windows is refused, and deliberately (`exec._unsupported_platform`: a Job Object
cannot be assigned until `CreateProcess` returns, so a grandchild started in that window — an
MCP server most of all — escapes it permanently).

The machinery is portable: `isolation.py`'s containment path contains no platform branch at
all. So is the recommended route — `[]` plus an environment token works anywhere, because the
token comes from the environment rather than from HOME, and the keychain never enters into it.
What does not port is the *negative* half of the finding: "the keychain is unreachable, so `[]`
is the only answer." On Linux there is probably a credential file under HOME that would let a
contained run work with no token exported, and nobody has looked; antigravity's `None` may be
wrong in its own favour there for the same reason. These declarations are therefore **correct
but incomplete** on Linux rather than false, and what is missing buys convenience, not safety.
Tracked in §6, along with the ordering constraint that matters more than the mapping itself:
the selftest is not Linux-clean, and a surface validated by a suite that does not pass is not
a measurement.

Three things worth carrying forward:

- **antigravity is a negative result, and it is recorded as one.** It has no env-var
  credential (its 1.1.7 binary contains no `GEMINI_API_KEY`/`GOOGLE_API_KEY` string) and its
  keychain is unreachable, so `contained_home_subpaths` stays `None` and the refusal keeps
  firing — which is the correct outcome, not a gap. Note the failure mode if anyone forces
  it: agy with no readable credential does not exit, it falls back to **interactive OAuth**
  and opens a browser at a Google sign-in page. A headless cell hangs there for 60s. The
  probe now suppresses browser launching by default for exactly this reason; the bisect that
  discovered it opened a sign-in tab on the operator's machine first.
- **codex is the one that pays.** It stores a file, and it reads no credential from the
  environment at all — an invalid `OPENAI_API_KEY` produces a response byte-identical to
  setting nothing, so the variable is never consulted in `exec` mode. The rotation hazard is
  therefore live: the child can rewrite its copy, and a rotated refresh token dies with the
  tempdir while the real store keeps the old one. Measured with `--rotation-check`: codex did
  **not** rewrite the copy, and the real `auth.json` was byte-identical after a full run.
  That is one run, whose token had last refreshed nine days earlier — it is not "codex never
  rotates", and it should be re-checked rather than cited.
- **codex cells could not run at all — found here, fixed here.** codex refuses to start
  outside a git repo or trusted project, every cell workspace is a detached tempdir, and
  nothing passed `--skip-git-repo-check`, so codex runs had been dying before reaching the
  model since at least 2026-07-17. It failed identically under the plain overlay, so
  containment did not cause it; mapping codex's surface is simply what made anyone look.
  The flag is now on both the cell and probe argv, and `cheapshot_harness_smoke` on
  gpt-5.4-mini passes **7/7** — the first codex cell this harness has completed.

  The flag rather than `git init`, deliberately: both clear the gate (verified 0.140.0), but
  codex resolves a *trusted project's* `.codex/config.toml` from the git root above cwd, and
  that file contributes MCP servers — so creating a repo in the workspace would open a config
  channel inside the one directory the agent can write to, after `_mcp_disable_args` has
  already enumerated. What the flag gives up is codex's guardrail against editing files it
  cannot roll back, which this harness does not rely on: the workspace is a throwaway tempdir
  that gets archived, and the sandbox stays `workspace-write` with approvals off.

  Worth noting how it hid for ten days: **a cell that never starts is indistinguishable from
  a cell that failed.** The result was a red cell with an error string, which is what a bad
  model answer also looks like. Arm `codex.skips_the_git_repo_trust_gate` exists so it cannot
  hide again, on the probe path too — there the same defect is disguised as an *unavailable
  model*, which is worse.

Verification: selftest **477 arms** (474 on `main`, +3), `mutate_mcp.py` **88/88** caught by the intended arm
(M86 codex-surface-collides-with-its-skills-dir, M87 copilot-env-strips-a-declared-credential-var,
M88/M89 codex-loses-the-trust-gate-flag on the cell and probe argv), plus two live runs:
`cheapshot_harness_smoke` on copilot with `GH_TOKEN` set, which ran **contained** rather than
refused and left **zero** occurrences of the token across the artifact tree; and the same
scenario on codex/gpt-5.4-mini, which passes **7/7**.

The rest of this doc is the original handoff. §1's cost table is still the right analysis; it
simply resolves to "free" for three adapters and "real" for one.

---

## 1. The job

**Credential-bearing MCP runs are refused. Make them possible without lying about it.**

A scenario whose `mcp_servers:` interpolates a `${VAR}` is currently refused before the agent
launches. That is correct today and it blocks the headline feature of Phase 1.

Why it is refused: the isolated HOME is a symlink **mask**, not a sandbox. `_overlay()` passes
every unmasked real-HOME entry through as a symlink, so `$HOME/.cache/x` *is* `~/.cache/x`,
and writing to a passed-through file overwrites the real one. Once an MCP tool result can
hand the resolved token back to the model, the model can write it where this harness neither
deletes nor scrubs. Deleting the overlay afterwards proves nothing about where its symlinks
pointed, and there is no scrub available: the harness does not know which of the real home's
directories were written to and will not go searching a user's home.

So the refusal is not conservatism to be relaxed. **Lifting it requires actually containing
the writes.**

### The open decision (SETTLED 2026-07-23 → materialize; see §0. Kept for the reasoning.)

| | Materialize | Allowlist + verify |
|---|---|---|
| What | Build only the adapter's declared config surface. Real directories, files **copied**, no outward symlinks at all. | Keep declared auth files as symlinks; hash them before and after the run; fail the cell if content changed. |
| Guarantee | Prevention | Detection after the fact |
| Cost | Per-adapter empirical work: nobody knows what each CLI actually needs from HOME. Needs live runs. | Small; lands soon. |
| Downside | Duplicates the user's long-lived CLI credentials into a per-cell tempdir. | The token is already in the real file by the time you notice. |

Prior lean (mine, not decided): **materialize**, because this whole line of work has been
"answer about the world, not about the call", and detection-after-the-fact is the weaker
sibling of that. The credential-duplication concern is real but it is precisely what the
`_purge`/`_remove` machinery exists to clean up, at `0700`, verifiably.

Note the forcing constraint: **our own escape rule is "any symlink resolving outside the
overlay."** A contained HOME therefore contains *no* outward symlinks — including auth. Under
materialize, auth files must be copied, not linked. That is not an incidental detail; it is
the crux of the cost.

Failure mode of materialize is a CLI erroring because something it needed was not declared —
fails closed, which is right, but it is a slow live-run loop per adapter.

---

## 2. What already exists (do not rebuild)

| Thing | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `home_write_escapes(home)` | `agentskill_evals/isolation.py` | Every symlink in the overlay whose `realpath` falls outside it. **This is the lifting condition** — when it returns `[]`, the refusal stops firing on its own. Do not add special cases to it; make the HOME satisfy it. |
| `_refuse_uncontained_home(home, eval_name, refs)` | `agentskill_evals/runner.py` | The refusal. Also refuses when `home is None` (no overlay = real HOME). |
| `interpolated_refs(servers)` | `agentskill_evals/mcp.py` | Which declared fields carry a `${VAR}`. The exposure gate. **Never** use `bool(secrets)` for this — short values are excluded from redaction on purpose and are still credentials. |
| `build_isolated_home(...)` / `_overlay(...)` | `agentskill_evals/isolation.py` | The overlay builder you will be changing. `_overlay` step 1 is the wholesale symlink pass — the thing that creates every escape. |
| `_CellCleanup` / `_purge` / `_remove` | `agentskill_evals/runner.py` | Registration + verified outward-in removal of credential directories, with findings that survive a crash. If you copy credentials anywhere, register the directory here. |
| `probe_contained_home.py` | `harness/tools/` | Maps an adapter's contained surface against the real CLI, driving the harness's own launch path. `--bisect` is the subtractive search that finds where a CLI's credential lives; `--rotation-check` reports whether the child rewrote a copied credential; `--overlay` is the control that separates "containment broke it" from "already broken". Suppresses browser launching by default — a CLI that cannot authenticate may fall back to interactive OAuth. |
| `_scrub_tree` and friends | `agentskill_evals/runner.py` | Archived-workspace scrub. Not in scope, but read `_scrub_file`/`_scrub_link` before writing any new filesystem traversal — they encode the object-kind inventory the hard way. |

Adapter contract fields that declare HOME surface (`adapters/base.py`):
`global_skills_subpaths`, `isolation_config_masks`, `plugin_registry_config_masks`,
`global_plugin_registry_subpaths`, `isolation_config_homes`.
Materialize will likely need a new one — "these subpaths must be materialized writable" — and
that is an adapter-contract change, so it needs a default that fails closed.

---

## 3. Constraints that must not regress

These are settled. They cost ten review rounds; do not relitigate them in code.

1. **A fact learned by executing a program the agent independently executes again may not
   CLEAR a security decision.** Version telemetry may *warn*; only the runtime contract may
   *pass* a run.
2. **The executing version is read from the run's own structural telemetry** — never a probe,
   never model-controlled text (assistant prose), never workspace-controlled text
   (`source: "project"` skill paths).
3. **Adapters fail closed rather than degrade silently.**
4. **Secrets:** `${VAR}` from the harness process env only; fail-fast at validation; never
   committed in YAML; scratch config `0600`, outside the workspace, deleted post-run; every
   interpolated secret scrubbed from all artifacts including recorded `argv`.
5. **The exec workspace is unconditionally detached** and moved into `artifacts/` afterwards.
   Not tied to the isolation flag — a cwd is a write capability.
6. **Deletion is answered by `os.path.lexists`, not by "did this raise."**
7. **A finding is forgotten only once it is on disk**, and acknowledged at the return, because
   `_failed_cell` *rewrites* `result.json` from a rebuilt result.

### 3a. The credential-handling invariant (cost four review rounds; do not rediscover)

**Credential presence, redaction values, containment, refusal, and cleanup severity must all
derive from the same effective environment supplied to the child, after scenario overrides.**

That environment is one expression: `child_env = {**os.environ, **(spec.env or {})}` — the merge
`exec.execute` itself builds (`base = dict(os.environ); base.update(spec.env)`). Every credential
decision in `_run_cell_body` reads from it. The four P1 findings this branch closed were each a
different decision reading from a *narrower* source:

- **Presence** (`has_credentials`) scans the adapter's `credential_env_vars` against `child_env`.
  Sampling `os.environ` missed a token supplied only via `spec.env` (P1d): the child got it, the
  harness didn't — so no containment, no refusal, no redaction, yet the token was delivered.
- **Redaction values** are read `child_env[name]`, not `os.environ[name]`. A `spec.env` override
  reaches the child, so redacting the ambient value scrubs the wrong string and leaks the real
  one (P1a registered the env token at all; P1d fixed which value gets registered).
- **Containment** (materialize a contained HOME) and **refusal** (`_refuse_uncontained_home`,
  including under `isolated: false`) key off that same presence signal — an env credential
  triggers them exactly as an interpolated `${VAR}` does, not only when `mcp_servers:`
  interpolates (P1c).
- **Cleanup severity** (`_CONTAINED_TAIL` + `fatal=` on the HOME registration, vs `_EXPOSED_TAIL`)
  treats a HOME that *copies* long-lived auth as credential-bearing from the moment it is
  registered, before the copy lands (P1b).

Every hole had the same shape: a credential decision reading something narrower than the child's
effective env (the process env alone, or an interpolated field alone). Don't reintroduce one.

**`credential_env_vars` is a survival assertion.** Naming a variable there asserts that the
adapter's `env()` forwards it into the child *unchanged* — it survives the transformation. The
runner samples `child_env` **before** `adapter.env()` runs and trusts the value arrives, which
holds only because `base.env()` mutates HOME/USERPROFILE/XDG/config-home vars and copies
everything else through verbatim: it can neither add nor drop a credential name. A future adapter
whose `env()` rewrote or stripped a declared credential var would break this — the harness would
redact and contain on a value the child never received — so do not declare a variable the adapter
transforms without also teaching detection about the transform.

Locked by arms `credential_detection_reads_the_childs_effective_environment`,
`credential_env_var_triggers_containment_without_mcp_servers`,
`credential_env_var_run_is_refused_under_isolated_false`, `adapter_credential_env_var_is_redacted`,
and `contained_home_that_copies_auth_is_credential_bearing_before_the_copy` (mutations M81–M85).

---

## 4. Verification protocol

Non-negotiable, in this order. `SELFTEST PASSED` alone is not evidence.

```sh
harness/.venv/bin/python -m agentskill_evals.cli selftest          # 486 arms
harness/.venv/bin/python -m compileall -q harness/agentskill_evals/
harness/.venv/bin/python -m pyflakes harness/agentskill_evals/*.py harness/agentskill_evals/adapters/*.py
python3 harness/tools/mutate_mcp.py                               # 110/110 caught by the intended arm
git diff --check
```

Those two counts are the floor as of the MCP witness axis, and they only ever go up: a lower
number means arms or mutations were LOST, which is the one outcome neither command reports as
a failure. Bump them in the same commit that adds arms. (They were previously written as
"N on main; M after this change", which is a form that is stale the moment the change lands —
and was, for two PRs.)

Pre-existing pyflakes noise, leave alone: unused `load_spec` in `cli.py:22`, unused `Optional`
in `adapters/__init__.py:9`, unused `os` in `adapters/codex.py:23`, and many "f-string is
missing placeholders" in `selftest.py`.

**What `VersionProvenance` does and does not buy.** It is an **audit trail plus a drift
warning**, not verification, and anything written as though it re-checks a claim per build is
overstating it (caught in review of #93). A build outside `_VERIFIED_VERSIONS` *warns and still
runs*. claude's own `witness_held` text says the runtime witness cannot distinguish "the flag
worked" from "a newer build grew a server source outside the flag's reach". codex has less
again: `_VERSION_UNREADABLE` records that it cannot identify the build it just executed at all,
because `--ephemeral` suppresses the only file that carries the version — so its sole check is
an out-of-band `codex --version`. Reviewed assertions that rest on a CLI mechanism
(`mcp_off_mechanism = CLI`, the `--strict-mcp-config` argument, codex's argv disables) are
exactly that: **reviewed**. Nothing here would catch a wrong one. What the machinery buys is
that an unaudited build is *visible* and that re-establishing a claim has a documented
procedure (`clear_hint`).

**Every new arm must be mutation-tested.** Add the mutation to `harness/tools/mutate_mcp.py`
in the same commit as the arm. An arm nothing can break is decorative, and this project has
caught its own decorative arms four separate times.

Things that have gone wrong in the *tests*, so you can skip learning them again:

- A FIFO fixture on the main thread wedged the whole suite under the mutation that makes the
  scrub read every non-directory. Use a **socket** — same `_give_up` branch, but `open()`
  fails `ENXIO` instead of blocking. The one arm that genuinely needs a FIFO joins a 20s
  thread for exactly this reason.
- An 8-space mutation anchor is a substring of the same call indented 12 spaces elsewhere in
  the file. It matched the wrong site and injected an `IndentationError`, which the runner
  reports as "failed, but NOT via" — not as a defect found. Pin anchors with a leading
  newline, and check the mutant still parses.
- A test's cleanup must not be able to reach further than what it created. A mutation that
  changed `exec_ws` made a fixture's `rmtree(dirname(cwd))` resolve to the **system temp
  dir** and it deleted its own working tree. Fixtures now verify the shape before touching.
- Selftest arms within one section share mutable setup, and a raise aborts the siblings.
  There is a `_try` helper and a per-section crash guard; use them.
- A test helper that walked a **real-home overlay** with `home_write_escapes` was harmless at
  `followlinks=False` but, under the M65 mutation that flips it to `followlinks=True`, walked
  the whole real home at 100% CPU and wedged the suite for tens of minutes. Never feed a
  real-home overlay to a walk a mutation can turn recursive; the fix gated that capture to the
  small contained-home fixtures only. `mutate_mcp.py` now also bounds each selftest with a
  `timeout` (reported as `TIMEOUT`, counted as *uncaught*), so a looping mutation is a finding
  rather than an infinite hang — but it is a backstop, not a licence to hang. Each result line
  also carries its selftest's wall time, and the summary names the slowest; read them against
  the `baseline:` line. A mutation at several times baseline is already the M65 shape, just not
  yet past the timeout, and that gap is the only warning anyone gets before it becomes a hang.

---

## 5. Suggested order

1. **Settle materialize vs allowlist.** Everything else depends on it.
2. Build the contained HOME for **one** adapter (claude — it is the only one with Phase 1 MCP
   delivery working end to end, verified live on 2.1.113). Prove `home_write_escapes()`
   returns `[]` for it and that the refusal lifts without touching the refusal.
3. Live-run `scenarios/mcp_echo_cred.yaml` (the credential variant of `mcp_echo_smoke.yaml` —
   `mcp_echo_smoke` itself interpolates no `${VAR}` and takes the plain overlay) and confirm
   the token is in no artifact and no real-home file. **[done for claude — §0]**
4. Only then generalize the adapter contract. **[the contract exists; the next adapter is the
   generalization test — its surface is almost certainly non-empty, unlike claude's.]**

**Do this next, and do it before more adapters:** the refusal lives in `_run_cell_body` and is
adapter-independent, so Phase 1b/2/3 credential runs are all gated behind this. Containment
also subsumes per-cell `$CODEX_HOME` materialization, which is already on the list as codex's
ABA fix and its route to `parallel_safe_config = True`.

## 6. Then, in order

- ~~**codex cannot run a cell at all — fix the trust gate first.**~~ **Done (2026-07-27)** —
  `--skip-git-repo-check` on the cell and probe argv; see §0b for the reasoning and for why
  it is the flag rather than `git init`.
- **Map the FILE-based contained surfaces on Linux — but not before the selftest passes
  there, and not before someone actually needs it.** Deliberately not scheduled; the trigger
  is a real Linux cell run or Linux CI, not tidiness.

  Scope it correctly, because the first version of this entry (and the summary that produced
  it) got it wrong in the alarming direction. What is macOS-specific is **not** the surfaces
  and **not** the machinery: `isolation.py`'s containment path has no platform branch at all
  (the one `darwin` mention is a comment about `normcase`), and the `[]` + environment-token
  route is platform-independent by construction — the token comes from the environment, never
  from HOME, so the keychain never enters into it. A Linux operator who exports `GH_TOKEN` or
  `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` gets a working contained run today.

  What is macOS-specific is the *negative* half of the claim: "the keychain is unreachable, so
  `[]` is the only answer." On Linux there is probably a credential FILE under HOME that would
  let a contained run work with no environment token at all, and it is unmapped. antigravity's
  `None` may be wrong in the same direction and in its favour — it is refused today because
  macOS gives it no route, and a Linux build storing a file would make it mappable. So the
  declarations are **correct but incomplete** on Linux, not wrong, and the missing piece buys
  convenience rather than safety.

  **The ordering is the part worth writing down: the selftest must be Linux-clean FIRST.** The
  suite is what proves the containment machinery is sound on a platform, and it is not clean
  there — a Linux run fails a symlink-scrub arm that passes on macOS, because several
  filesystem arms encode darwin semantics (xattrs on symlinks, hardlinked symlinks). Probing
  first would produce surfaces validated by a suite that does not pass, which is a measurement
  nobody can trust. Sequence: make the selftest Linux-clean → then `probe_contained_home.py
  --bisect` per adapter (~7 runs each; `--self-check` needs no logins, so it works on a bare
  CI box) → then decide whether the field needs to be platform-conditional. Write no
  `if sys.platform` before that last step: ahead of the measurement it is just a second guess.

  That Linux selftest failure is also why the parked CI workflow
  (`harness/ci-selftest-mutation`) runs on macOS runners rather than Linux, and it is the
  reason to fix, not a reason to switch platforms.
- **Phase 1b codex** — `-c` mapping + canonical `mcp__server__tool` naming in its parser.
  Blocked on §9 probe #2 (whether TOML array/inline-table values survive `-c`). Pairs with
  `$CODEX_HOME` materialization, above.
- **Phase 2 copilot** — `--additional-mcp-config @file`, per-server `tools`, `--secret-env-vars`.
- **Phase 3 antigravity** — MCP injection.
- **C3 harness-owned filtering proxy** — required before any scenario points `tools:` at a
  server its author does not control, and required for agy tool gating regardless.

Smaller, unblocked:

- ~~Report the **witnessed** MCP server set from the init event so MCP matrices can reach
  `verified`.~~ **Done (2026-07-28)** — `ParseOutput.mcp_servers_witnessed` carries
  `(name, status)` pairs from claude's init event along the path `cli_version` already takes,
  and `_consistency` prefers it over argv. The set and the health are **two axes**, because
  the first cut folded them together and manufactured both states it exists to prevent
  (unstated health reading as agreement, and as drift). The third state is what makes the
  split work and it is a property of the source: a witness that omits a status leaves health
  *unknown*, while argv names servers it **disabled**, which never ran and so have no health
  to state. See `DESIGN_MCP_Support.md` §8 Phase 1.
- Portable `used_mcp_tool` assertion (§7) once a second adapter lands.
- ~~Refuse `isolated: false` combined with `mcp_servers:`.~~ **Done (2026-07-28)**, narrowed
  from the flat phrasing: the refusal is a property of where the adapter's **kill-switch
  lives**, not of isolation. copilot and agy keep MCP off with masks in the overlay, so a
  cell with no isolated HOME loads the user's real servers beside the declared ones and is
  refused; claude (`--strict-mcp-config`) and codex (per-server disables) hold whatever HOME
  the child is handed, and a blanket rule would have refused the one configuration that
  works today for no safety gain. Classified by a declared **tri-state**
  (`mcp_off_mechanism`: `CLI`, `OVERLAY_MASKS`, or `None` for not-determined). Deriving it
  from mask presence answered "has a mask" rather than "depends on one"; a boolean then made
  *unclassified* share a value with *uses masks*, so an adapter nobody had classified was
  cleared by any isolated HOME — by an overlay materializing nothing for it (both found in
  review). `None` fails closed in BOTH directions, the same not-mapped-is-not-a-claim rule
  `contained_home_subpaths` uses. The two `CLI` declarations are reviewed assertions, not
  verified ones — see §4's note on what provenance does and does not buy.
  **Latent until an adapter is both** — the mask-dependent adapters are exactly the ones
  that cannot inject, so `validate_mcp_support` refuses them first. It arms itself the day
  copilot or agy gains injection, which is why it went in before that rather than after.
- Sweep for other default-held invariants (`judge`, `max_cells`, `provision`).
- Report the `mcp_servers:` + no-overlay refusal in the **CLI pre-flight** as well, next to
  `validate_mcp_support` in `cmd_run` — today it surfaces as a failed cell per cell, where
  the sibling MCP refusals surface before anything runs ("they will always fail and waste
  tokens"). Deliberately not done with the refusal itself: nothing in the selftest drives
  `cmd_run` (only `validate_spec`), so the pre-flight copy would be a second wording of the
  rule with no arm to keep it honest. The blocker is the missing `cmd_run` harness, not the
  check — build that first, or this lands decorative.

Still open in `DESIGN_MCP_Support.md` §9: claude's `mcpServers` http/sse JSON shape; copilot's
MCP tool-name format and plugin-declared server reach; agy's transcript tool-name format and
`url` vs `serverUrl`.
